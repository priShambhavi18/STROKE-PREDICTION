# STROKE-PREDICTION
The stroke prediction system is based on Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the health condition of the patient and based on the condition, the model itself predict the chances of the stroke occurrences. This model is capable to predict the stroke with the accuracy of around 96 %, and hence it can save various lives. 
The purpose:
 Improving the Accuracy and quality of stroke prediction system model by 96%
 stroke is a life-threatening medical illness, and it is better to treat it as soon as possible 
for avoiding future complications and the building of this model could help in early 
detection of stroke 
 Easing the workload of the doctors.
